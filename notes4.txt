1. Spring boot uses a parent project to
control your app

2. A developer can user various spring boot starters
to develop projects/services according to their needs

  for example if you user
      
	  spring-boot-starter-web
	  
	  spring boot assumes that you are going to 
	    build
		
		  1. web application
		  2. rest service
		  3. soap service
		  
		  all the libraries which are necassary for developing
		  and testing this three things would be downloaded
		  automatically
		
		When you are creating a restcontroller and request handlers
		
		spring boot by default assumes that input/request body
		in json format
		 and it will try to convert into java
		 
		 and similary when you are return java objects
		 it will convert into json by default
		 
		 but a developer has always option explicitly
		 specify whats the request content type is
		 and response content type by using attribute
		 produces and consumes
		 
similary at the data layer
